### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Dylan, a full stack developer with a background in the humanities ðŸ‘´ ENTJ-A  
For the moment I'm still pretty new to the world of programming, but already I can tell that I'm into...  
> Algorithms âž—  
> Data Visualization ðŸ“Š  
> VR ðŸ¥½  
> Design ðŸŽ¨  
> JavaScript, Python, and C# ðŸ’»  

*When Dylan isn't programming, you can find him sipping verbana on his gondola, hand-rolling cigars, and eating a block of cheese the size of a car battery in a recliner with a fridge in the side*

Just kidding, I only do one of those things. But you don't need to know about my personal "life."  
Professionally, I strive for perfection. I am fascinated with good mentorship and excellent planning and design. Just as I have found a niche in the world of programming, I hope to further refine my place as a pioneer in innovation, design/data architecture, and personal leadership.
